# BMAD Method Knowledge Base

## Core Methodology

The BMAD (Build-Measure-Adapt-Deploy) Method is a systematic approach to software development that emphasizes structured project management, clear role separation, and comprehensive documentation.

## Key Principles

1. **Config-Driven Development**: All agent behaviors and project structure are defined through configuration files
2. **Role-Based Specialization**: Each agent has a specific role and expertise area
3. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Every aspect of the project is thoroughly documented
4. **Systematic Task Management**: Tasks are broken down, tracked, and completed methodically
5. **Quality Assurance**: Testing and verification are built into every step

## Agent Roles Overview

- **Analyst**: Research, requirements gathering, project briefs
- **Product Owner**: PRD creation, story management, course correction
- **Architect**: Technical architecture, system design
- **Design Architect**: Frontend design, UX/UI specifications
- **Product Manager**: Product strategy, market analysis
- **Developers**: Implementation, testing, delivery
- **Scrum Master**: Story creation, process management

## Workflow Patterns

### Project Initialization
1. Project brief creation
2. Requirements analysis (PRD)
3. Architecture design
4. Epic breakdown
5. Story creation
6. Implementation cycles

### Development Cycles
1. Story selection and approval
2. Implementation with testing
3. Quality assurance verification
4. Documentation updates
5. Review and acceptance

## Best Practices

- Always maintain catalog systems for project tracking
- Use systematic checklists for quality assurance
- Preserve context through core dumps and session management
- Follow established file and folder structures
- Maintain clear separation of concerns between agents

## Integration Points

- Configuration files drive all agent behavior
- Template systems ensure consistency
- Checklist systems ensure completeness
- Catalog systems maintain project visibility
